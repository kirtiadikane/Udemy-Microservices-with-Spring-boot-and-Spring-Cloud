Step  - Spring Cloud API Gateway
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial

- http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

- http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-CONVERSION/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

- http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-CONVERSION/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10



Lower Case

- http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

- http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

- http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

Step 24: Exploring Routes with Spring Cloud Gateway
------------------------------------------------------------
http://localhost:8765/get


Custom Routes

- http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

- http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

- http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

- http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-feign-new/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

Spring Cloud gateway is an awesome way to route to your APIs and implement your crosscutting concerns. Things like security, monitoring, metrics, 
these are the best things that you can implement in a Spring Cloud gateway. This is built on top of Spring WebFlux, and that's the reason why we needed to use the reactive approach.
Some of the important features of Spring Cloud Gateway are it can match request on any request attribute.
